            <h3>About the Artist</h3>
            <p>
                Anita Magsaysay-Ho was a highly celebrated Filipina painter and the only female member of the "Thirteen Moderns," a pioneering group of modernists in Philippine art. She is best known for her Social Realist and Cubist-inspired paintings that celebrate the beauty, resilience, and camaraderie of everyday Filipino women engaged in labor, such as harvesting, cooking, and catching fish.
